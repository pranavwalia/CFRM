## Counterfactual Regret Minimization Implementations
Implementations of counterfactual regret minimization algorithm for various toy games. 
Uses AI agents and simultaneous learning to converge towards  optimal solutions.

Each game is contained inside a dedicated folder with a jupyter notebook solution with explanation as well as a pure python implementation
